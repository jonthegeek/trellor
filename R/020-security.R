# These functions were generated by the {beekeeper} package, based on
# components@security_schemes from the source API description. You may want to
# delete unused options. In addition, APIs often have additional security
# options that are not formally documented in the API description. For example,
# for any `location = query` `api_key` options, it might be possible to instead
# pass the same parameter in a header, possibly with a different name. Consult
# the text description of authentication in your API documentation.
